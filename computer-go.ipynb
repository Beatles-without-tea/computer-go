The output targets are the policy (a vector of size 361 with 1.0 for the move played, 0.0 for the other moves), and the value (close to 1.0 if White wins, close to 0.0 if Black wins). The policy network samples actions and the value network evaluates positions, these are used to reduce the depth of the search tree and the breadth of the search.\n","The number of parameters for the networks must be lower than 100 000.
